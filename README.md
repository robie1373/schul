# Schul (sounds like school) is a distributed schooling / flock simulator. 

## Standalnone versions

Simulate and render schuls all in one. Different versions may have differnt strategies in accordance with their strengths and weaknesses.

## Distributed Versions

Each visitor to the site will become a member of the flock. The simulation will run client side, sending location and vector data back to the orchestrator, and the entire flock will be rendered server-side.

## Why

To see how differences in latency affect the schul's behavior, to allow visitors to take paret in the generation of the schul, to experiment with orchestration, and because I have wanted to do a schul simulator for a while now.
